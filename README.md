# WebScraping_Realtor

RUN Instructions -> Simply run all the code blocks of the notebook. I have also provided a link to the notebook at the end, if it may be of any use. 

Some code which I have commented out, was helpful in some urls where the scrapped data was not in the required form. You can try for New York where city name was duplicated multiple times and did not look good in the final output. I used Regular Expressions to resolve that issue.

Thank You, I enjoyed working on the task and tried to solve it to the best of my understanding.
